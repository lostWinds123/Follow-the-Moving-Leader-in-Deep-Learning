# Follow-the-Moving-Leader-in-Deep-Learning

FTML is closely related to RMSprop and Adam. In particular, it enjoys their nice properties, but avoids their pitfalls. Experimental results on a number of deep learning models and tasks demonstrate that FTML converges quickly, and is always the best (or among the best) of the various optimizers.

We have experimented with a CNN model on MNIST dataset and LSTM model on tweets.
