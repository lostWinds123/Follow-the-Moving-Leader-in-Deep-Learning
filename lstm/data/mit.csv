The guy wearing the tech company tshirt: it's usually because he most probably interned there or because he got the tshirt during career fair. whatever the reason, he's gonna talk about the company on his tshirt coz he's course 2 or 6 or both.  2. The normal frat boy: It's his party (or he acts like it's his party). He most probably has a solo cup with way more than alcohol. He's pretty confident and will easily strike up a convo with any gal he is interested in. He'll mention the fact that he's a bro and will end up (or nearly end up or try to end up) getting up your pants.  3. The adonis: Few and far between at MIT. He's most probably from another uni. Like the normal frat guy, he's confident. He usually has girls throw (or throwing up) themselves onto him. He gets all the girls' numbers. A hot commodity indeed.  4. The douche: He'll ask u to fuck him the minute he starts talking to u. He'll stalk all the girls he is interested in. He'll try to manhandle you on the dancefloor. Overly confident. Avoid at all costs.  5. The nerdy frat guy: This is MIT. Expect to meet this dude. He doesn't wear clothes that nicely dressed MIT frat boys wear. You never see him in frat letters. He's a knowledgeable dude and will strike up a conversation with a fellow sapiosexual. He's easily offended by 'dumb' women.  6. Gay dude: BFF material. Hilarious, confident and usually sexy or cute. Unfortunately he wont touch you, girl.  7. The animal: He is from the bush. He lurks at all the beer kegs and imbibes unreasonable amounts of alcohol. He will puke then drink more then pass out. Expect him to take his shirt off during beer pong or on the dancefloor or anywhere.  8. The teetotaller: He just observes proceedings and is basically the unofficial monitor of the party. He's unapproachable, especially if u have a solo cup in your hand. He is the quietest guy u will ever meet at a partyf. Why did he come to the party? who knows....  9. The freshman: Overly eager, immature and pliable. It's his first (or one of his first) college parties. He is all in and tries everything. He experiences success and failures during the night. Whatever happens, he wont forget tonite and will have a story to tell to his grandchildren.",,status,,2017-09-19 11:08:00,286,43,8,231,1,5,46,3,0,0

Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",,status,,2017-02-25 0:02:00,26,16,3,16,1,1,7,0,1,0

If we use our energy in a poor way, we may inadvertently help him. The reason I bring this up is I've seen some people here denounce his supporters as nothing but racists, bigots, and people they want no business with. Like it or not, if we don't get at least some of this crowd on our side, we are not winning back the House, Senate, or presidency. The first thing is we need to stop the name calling, even if it's justified. Think about it, if someone calls you a racist, how open will you be to their ideas? About as open as they are to us. A good chunk of this country looks at us at MIT like a bunch of snotty, higher then thou, out of touch elitists who don't care about anyone but ourselves. I know this is not true, but that's image out there we need to combat. When you get on social media and call anyone who supports Trump names, you help perpetuate that stereotype. How are we going to change their minds? Simple, we are going to ignore Trumps bait and simply refute his claims in a calm and dignified manner. He wants us to melt down at a rally on CNN. It makes his supporters hate us, and like him. We are going to use stats to show that immigrants are very unlikely to commit terrorism, where a drunk driver is more likely to harm you. And we will calmly proceed to refute him as many times as necessary. This will be a long and difficult process with many setbacks to come. Some of you are saying what Trump has said is disgusting and unforgivable and your anger is justified. It certainly is. But regardless, you need to put aside your feelings and make the strategic choice, rather then the one that feels the best right now. Some of you may argue that I don't know what it's put you through. That is also true, but I do know what we all have to do if we want to win. Should we have to do this? No, but it's what we're stuck doing now. Life isn't fair, get used to it.",,status,,2017-02-07 1:14:00,50,8,1,44,5,1,0,0,0,0

      I was thirteen years old, grateful to be playing a sport I loved with friends and parents who supported me. I didn't want to let anyone down, and somehow I knew that his habit of sneaking his hands underneath my pants to warm them up would disappoint others. 
       I was fourteen years old, and I was lucky. I squirmed and hated the touching, the groping, but he never took it to extremes. They're only hands and hands can't hurt you, I would tell myself as his fingers explored. He was smart--no, cunning--and knew just how to manipulate my boundaries and keep me quiet. He critiqued my bras and makeup and the new boys in my life, and I just nodded and swallowed my sense of self-respect. He found excuses to take me to away competitions and train me one-on-one. It was an honor, right? I did not cry.  
     I was fifteen years old, and I gradually developed a losing streak. I went through practice numbly. Slowly, I stopped showing up, justifying it with feigned laziness. In reality, it was an orchestrated escape. I made it out and let myself forget about him.

I'm pretty sure it started long before coming to MIT; the academic stress of this environment has merely allowed it to rear its ugly head unobstructed. The idea of getting psychiatric help has been sitting at the back of my mind for years, but I'd never placed much credence in it. I thought I would become subject to the criticism I already feared others felt towards me. I thought that I should just power through it, just do my best to match up to my peers socially and (more recently) academically. But that's not my only qualm about it anymore.  I'm now concerned because this has probably been going on for years. What I feel now doesn't feel like I've taken a turn in any direction. I simply feel like what I am is just an amplified version of what I was. I'm afraid that I don't know exactly when I got on this train, but I've definitely been here for quite a while.  My decisions at every level, every step I've ever taken, every word I've ever said, every success I've won and failure I've earned, EVERYTHING that makes me ""me"" could be largely attributed to a psychiatric disorder. The person my friends here have known for 2.5 years, the person who thought that this would be the one place where he would truly fit in, the person who felt genuinely thrilled when he saw the words ""... it is my pleasure to offer you..."", could be greatly diminished by a series of therapy sessions and well-regimented MAOIs. My entire personality could be nothing but the product of a disorder.  Nevertheless, I'm going to look into treatment. I'm not in a position where I can just sit on it and hope it ferments into some slightly better end product.

Just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean I think he's anywhere close to a good person. Like many people who voted for Trump, I'm hesitant and worried about our country going forward. His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently.

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

I've seen them have it-- when they got sick, their parents sent them soup. When they wanted to buy their brass rats, they got loans from their parents. When their boyfriend/girlfriends broke their hearts, they talked it through with their parents. I mean, like I'm happy they're independent and have grown out of needing their family, but I never got to grow out of needing my family. I took care of my parents, not really the other way around, and it bums me out sometimes. 

I'd give anything to know what it's like to call your mom at the end of the day and talk about school and life and the cute guy that I'm crushing on in my morning class, and to have the conversation end in an ""I love you, no matter what anyone tells you, you're doing great.""

But we don't live in a vacuum as much as this page suggests.  I really want to believe that not as many people act apathetic because they really don't care but because they don't know how or why to care. If there are more opportunities to get involved and people understand how the system can create change in our lives then maybe people will also pay more attention.  Whether its funding research, better healthcare, better STEM education, more opportunities and jobs, or just being able to feel like you have a say in the system that structures your life, politics isn't this just a thing that loud overly opinionated people do. It's a way of engaging your community and making it better for everyone.  You can register to vote, help people register, get involved with MIT Democrats, Republicans, whatever you stand for, generally read news, learn about how things in Cambridge change and get changed, whatever it is you want to do to feel engaged.

Once, he even allowed me to just sit in his office and work on the project while he worked on his own stuff, and let me ask really dumb questions if I needed too.

462508190484900_1072353626167017,u,"#6549 Every semester I've been here I've gotten an email from a concerned professor about my performance. This year both times it happened I just got really annoyed, even though I know they mean well. I've accepted that I'm a C student, because MIT forced me to. I recently switched to the flexible version of my major with a HASS minor so I wouldn't have to take hard classes anymore, but even now on 36 units of easy classes, even with all that extra time to commit to individual classes and the lack of sleep deprivation, I'm still getting that email. But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.

But I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class. For the first time I was understanding what I was learning in a technical class, and I got full credit on some pset and exam problems, which is also a first. This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him. Usually the message I get from these meetings is, ""just get higher scores."" Guess I just have to grin and bear it like always and flounder my way to graduation.

462508190484900_1070490503019996,u,"#6480 So I just read that the US may start forcing women to register for the draft and I think that's fucked up on many levels. The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there? 

I am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.

I get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not ""anti-America"" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.

I'm just irritated now. It's late, I'm tired, and what I read just made me really angry so I probably did not develop my points as well as I should have or even used the most proper and/or accurate terms, so I guess you can say this was more of an angry rant. I'll do more research on this later but I just wanted to blow off some steam right now.",,status,,2016-04-29 2:04:55,14,9,1,11,0,0,0,0,3,0

It took MIT over 3 years to make Add/Drop forms be online.  It still hasn't done this for minor forms.  If that takes at least 3 years then even considering a change to any of the things you listed will take well over that amount of time.  In a way, it is discouraging. But I think the better way to think about it is that the world won't change overnight either - it should be a lesson of perseverance and determination to enact change and not get discouraged if it takes a really long time.  

To be clear though, I'm not justifying MIT's slowness to change. I'm against huge bureaucracies for this reason. I'm also not a fan of saying at least we're more progressive than the Ivies where it takes even longer to change things.

I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S. 

While I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Buñuel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by ""greedy"" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge. 

No Bernie, I refuse to ""feel the bern"", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.

Meanwhile US population vs MIT population for other races respectively is about 12% to 10%(even though many black students will say that is number is more realistically 5-6%) for Black students, 16% to 14% for Hispanic/Latino students, and 63% to 51% for White/Caucasian students.

I mean, if you don't like someone then that's one thing, and if you have a certain group of people you usually do stuff with, then good for you.  But if you have a friend that wants to hang out with your click or whatever, then why is that friend all of a sudden cast in the shadows as if he/she isn't even there?

It really doesn't make sense, especially if you are very familiar with everyone in the friend group.

Yes, I could hang out with other people, and that's what I've been doing nowadays.  The problem is, I see these people just about everyday, and that always reminds me that for some unknown reason, I can't interact with them the way I used to.

462508190484900_1026950387374008,u,"#4193 Both political parties have good ideas, take the best from each.

Those of you on the left, understand that the right wants to maintain the society we have. We want a society that allows free discourse of all ideas. A society that is tolerant of all ideas cannot import people who are intolerant of all ideas, as that is destructive to that society. Whether you wish to acknowledge it or not, Western liberal ideas are primarily held by those who are from Western liberal societies and those that have been influenced by Western liberal societies. Immigrants must assimilate into our culture for our society to survive. Most individuals from certain cultural backgrounds have shown themselves incapable of assimilation. We cannot allow these people into our society. A tolerant society paradoxically must be intolerant of those who are intolerant.

Those on the right, understand that the left is fighting for equality of opportunity for all people regardless of who you are. Just as you are opposed to socialism because it takes money from those who work and gives it to those who do not, you must also be opposed to allowing dynasties of elites to form, as is the case in libertarian societies.

I can't tell what is being asked of me.
I feel like things are more relatable if you ask for some well-defined goal to be met. For example, wanting women to have the right to vote. That is a goal with clear metrics and observable change. It is immediately understood if the goal is met or not.
Now, a lot of the talk I am exposed to seems so abstract. I hear more about a passionate ""we will overcome this"" mindset than I hear about what metrics are being used. I think, for the sake of everyone, it is better to at least define some goals, even if they are a proxy for what is actually desired. I understand things are complex... But I will only ever live within my own set of experiences, so the more relatable and understandable your problems are to me, the more I will naturally support your side. I feel hesitation and uncertainty when I try to support something that sounds abstract and purely subjective.
By the way, I actually think this approach will gain a larger and more diverse following. Instead of focusing on limiting and scolding others for certain actions, focus on asking for a logical, desirable change. I understand it may feel like you are catering to the whims of the privileged with this method, but I believe the mutual understanding and support that can be achieved is more than worth it.

I was reading MIT confessions and I saw the hatred for the Burton-Connor lady and then there was the Senior Haus confession. We lovingly tease our housemaster and AD and house manager; I have yet to see any actual tension arise between residents and the house team (except in the case of Ken meets fire hazard but that's more of a Ken-fire-hazard personal issue) and it's one of the few things that truly make finals week significantly better. 
Seeing the stark contrast between how we feel about our house team and the BC people, how many haus people respond to haus confessions in fun ways, it hits home that the reason I'm still here is because there's no other place that I could imagine being even relatively happy.

We will start a tradition, the Infinite Streak, that on the night before finals begin every term (Sunday, Dec 13, this term), we meet in Lobby 7 just before 10pm, and at exactly 10pm, strip naked, and run down the Infinite and back.  All are welcome and hopefully we'll get a good gender mix of runners along with some spectators to cheer them on. It will be a great way to relieve stress. Please spread the word and like and share this with your friends, dorms, frats, sororities, clubs, teams, etc.  Start a tradition of doing the run within your group, or start your own goal of doing 8 of 8 naked runs.
(FAQ: Why down the Infinite and back and not a loop? If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again.  What do I wear when I show up?  Clothes or a towel.  Where do I leave the clothes?  In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends.  Why doesn't the run go outside?  Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside.  What about cameras?  Spectators and runners alike will probably bring their cameras to document the run and we can't stop them.  Do I have to be totally naked?  It's encouraged, but we certainly can't require it.)

They tell me ""you couldn't understand, you've never failed a test before in your life"". They tell me, ""even when you think you've done badly, you still usually beat the average"". 

Since when does doing better than other people define whether we're doing well? Why can't I feel as if I've done poorly if I didn't live up to my potential, no matter how far above or below average I was? It's not about doing better than other people, it's about doing better than you think that you can do.

And even more, since when does our grades define the quality of our lives? Just because I've never failed a test doesn't mean that I don't know what it means to fail, to be disappointed in myself, or to face hardships.

462508190484900_976487032420344,u,"#3020 I am an Evangelical Christian here on campus. I don't hide what I am, and most of my friends here are agnostic or atheist. We all get along just fine. One question I frequently get asked, I would like to address here. The question is, ""why doesn't your church do things to be more fun, accept birth control, cohabitation, female priests, and other serious changes"". People usually add to that how those changes would bring back young people in droves. Lets talk about fun, church is not meant to be fun. Church is about learning how to live your life, and to keep you on the right path. Lectures here are not always fun, but you still go, because you understand their need. People who leave church because it's not, ""fun"", are like people who leave lectures here they paid for, they missed the entire point. Next, accepting homosexuality, cohabitation, female priests, etc, etc. The reason we do not do these things is because all of these things are against the core doctrines of our church. We follow the lessons of the bible, the bible strictly forbids cohabitation and birth control violates the spirit of being open to life. We also forbid them because we empathize putting others before yourself, this includes creating stable working families, where you put the needs of the other members before yourself, even if it is at your own detriment. Cohabitation encourages you to seek your own pleasure, above the needs of others. (There is also plenty of psychological research showing this.) Some people have argued against this from a survival standpoint saying we should do it anyway just to get new members. We are not a popularity contest. Jesus when asked if he was king replied, ""My Kingdom is not of this world"". We are not a worldly crowd, nor do we want to be. And even if we were, the majority of students here at MIT would not show up anyway. You would all know that we were changing the doctrines in a cynical attempt to bring you. Did you know there are many new protestant sects that accept homosexuality, female priests, cohabitation, and other things? If you ask why you haven't heard of them it's because they collapse almost as fast as they rise. People stay faithful because faith challenges them, not tells them what they want to hear. What we actually do in my hometown is lead a strict, but loving congre",,status,,2015-11-28 15:51:56,2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

462508190484900_975321715870209,u,"#2979 2888, I still have nightmares about you, not super often, but still.  Either aboutsomehow ""accidentally"" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had.  I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship.  Never treat someone how you treated me.  Your last message makes me hope you did learn.  You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.  

I want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else:  No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety.  I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them.  Do not let them hold you hostage by your love.  If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them.  Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff.  If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly.  If they say, ""if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]"", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you.  Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real.  If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change.  You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again.  Leave them.  Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it.  Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more.  Never let fear control you.  

If you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR.  They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually  really difficult if you are blinded by love.  Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you.  Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.

The choice as I see it is A) Does the US accept the refugees, knowing it is likely that some percentage of them will be malicious agents taking advantage of the crisis to immigrate, or B) Does the US accept none of them (or perhaps a third option, does the US accept a subset that is likely to be harmless? Eg. children only, though that would be heartbreaking for those families and not necessarily the best option for those children, etc.).

To argue that innocent refugees should be welcomed because they're decent human beings is to argue against a straw man (Well, it may SHOULD be arguing against a straw man, though some politicians' comments seem to indicate they might actually be opposed to this sentiment...). If governments had divining rods that could tell who was and wasn't intending to perpetrate violence on others, this decision would be much more straightforward.

I just wanted to articulate this distinction. I think it's very possible to be in favor of A) above; but the proper articulation is ""I support accepting all of the refugees, because helping the innocent ones is more important than preventing the damage that might be caused by the malicious agents"", not simply ""I support welcoming Syrians"".

The roaring laughter that ensues, is not only confusing, but painful to me because I feel that this joke hugely undermines the progress MIT has made towards racial inclusion. 

I'm not the best at discussing whats racist and whats not--I find my emotions usually get the best of me in these conversations. In the face of these issues, I usually just shrug my shoulders and learn to live with the harm. I'm not trying to impose on his freedom of speech, I just am fearful of what harm this might propagate when you have a very admired professor at a world class institution showing his students that there is no harm caused when making jokes like this.

I almost want to post a link of the joke here (its on OCW and youtube, which is how I suspect he makes the same joke every year), but I'm not sure if it would do any good to publicly shame him and have people comment on his specific word use or debate whether or not what he said was actually harmful. But to me, when someone makes a joke where the punchline is based on the western born stereotype that ""all asians look the same"" , well that brings up a lot of pain, especially if this person is well respected in a community that students of color are trying to thrive in.

Its been a year now, and these memories and this pain still resurfaces whenever conversations of race come up in the news. These videos are still on youtube. And he'll probably make the same joke again this year. I'm looking for some closure or a solution but its not the easiest to talk to people who demand to be convinced with whatever they deem to be logical when the harm is a very obvious experience for me.",,status,,2015-11-13 14:38:16,9,1,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0

462508190484900_969152453153802,f,"#2571 Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours. I sat down in an empty chair next to a girl whom I had not seen before. This girl was wearing a hijab. Naturally, I have no idea if she is Palestinian, simply anti-Israel, or what her views are, and quite frankly I could not care less. She's a student at MIT, like me, and she is here to learn, like me. She looked at me, and I smiled (even though the socially-awkward side of me panicked as it does whenever someone looks at me and I had to confirm to myself that my breath didn't smell and that I did shower that day). I did notice, though, that her eyes lingered on the Star of David necklace I was wearing. Without hesitation, she picked up her notes and sat away from me. Obviously, I do not know what she was thinking and maybe she simply could see better further back in the classroom. I did not let this bother me, though if you're reading this, I am sorry if I offended you. The second, more concerning event, happened before the ""Israeli Impunity and the Palestinian Reality"" event. Although I do not agree with the angry and perhaps hateful undertones of this event, I do support free speech and I am happy that students and faculty who are anti-Israel feel safe enough to voice their opinions. I was walking down the Infinite prior to the event; I saw a massive line of people and had no idea what was going on. I asked someone what was going on, and she said ""A talk by Dr. Chomsky on the injustices from bloodthirsty Jews"". As she was saying this, the person she was with looked at my Star of David necklace and then proceeded to say something in Arabic to the woman I was speaking with. The woman then proceeded to loudly and angrily exclaim that I was ""venomous"" and a ""disgusting murderer"" to which others in line turned to us. I was so alarmed and taken aback that I quickly walked away. I even felt unsafe to walk back to my dorm alone later that evening. I do not know whether these people were MIT affiliated or not. I do not feel that students should be censored in their political beliefs. I feel censorship can create an environment that could be deemed unsafe to students. What I do believe, though, is that people should be weary of when their beliefs transform into hatred. I am not Israeli nor do I have a strong opinion on the situation, and I have not even been to Israel. Yet, due to my cultural and religious identity I was verbally attacked in front of many people. I have not been here for a full semester, yet I have already experienced this hatred. I feel unsafe to wear my Star of David necklace that I have been wearing for years let alone discuss this matter. We are all students- most is not all of whom have played no role in this conflict. All student groups should be tolerant of each other's beliefs even if there is disagreement. But no student should be subject to personal discrimination and no student should ever feel that their safety is threatened.",,status,,2015-11-11 18:11:14,81,6,6,81,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a black non-American male who can actually dance, [as confirmed by my awards from dancing competitions] lets say I am actually frustrated by the type of girls I meet on the dance floor at MIT and around the Boston area. (Am 21+) . In my experience, I have met two types of girls.

1) The white, asian [including Indians of course], or black girl who is insecure or probably lacks exposure and refuses to dance with any black male. I make this conclusion because I see them dancing with another  non-black male immediately after they turn down dancing with me. And repeat this disgusting behaviour throughout the party. I actually try to watch to see if I can prove myself wrong. Unfortunately, they prove me right every fucking time.

2)  The ones who understand that a party is just a party and are willing to dance with anyone who can prove that they got moves.

Now, if you belong to group two, clap for yourself. Those who belong to group one however, should check themselves or their prejudices. Do you prefer dancing with non-black males to black males? Why?...
Do you understand that this behaviour could have a racist undertone? If you act this way because of what the media perpetuates, check yourself. Relax and have fun. Parties are supposed to be fun and not a space to bring whatever racist tendencies you have. 

This post about discrimination also rings true for black women and online dating as well... but I won't delve into that for sake of brevity.

I feel like this part of the world is overly obsessed with unfounded assumptions about races to the point where communities at schools like MIT and other schools around the Boston area are so segmented. Lets chill and have fun people, We share more in common than our differences to be honest...

I think I’m a dumb, ugly, unmotivated, boring, socially awkward dysfunctional piece of shit. That’s what goes through my head, constantly.

I have issues... my biggest one is that I'm AFRAID of people. Paralyzingly afraid of people. Always worried about what people think of me, always fearing I’m being watched and judged in public. I have a huge social anxiety problem. And it's cause I hate myself and have no confidence. It’s probably why I never reach out to people for new friends or jobs.

I’m tired of spending entire weekends in my room, only going out for bathroom breaks and to get dinner in a green box. I’m tired of spending hours on a pset failing to make any real progress. I’m tired of struggling in office hours, hearing people say they get it and it all makes sense now when I’m still confused, probably on a problem before the one they just got. I’m tired of not being able to get help when I feel this way because I can’t talk properly to whoever comes to help me, in excruciating discomfort and fear that they and whoever else is overhearing will probably think I’m a dumbass.

I’ll never deliberately kill myself. I’m too scared of the possibility of hell, and I don’t want to put my family through the grief. But I feel trapped in my inhibitions. I have to change something. But I’m not going to S^3 or mental health to do it, cause that’s more people, and they’ll probably just kick me out.

462508190484900_963649360370778,u,"#2343 After being at MiT for a couple of years I've had a lot experiences that have redefined my self-identity as an academic and a person. We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.

For me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT
may be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching. 

See, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in. 
After a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say ""you'll learn through the Pset"" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you  don't even have time to sleep here. 

Now say what you will about MiT needing to be ""rigorous"" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute. 
I have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.

Great researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.

I'm just writing this because I feel others can relate and this sentiment should be voiced

And this makes them feel awful but their friends tell them ""you are below average at a top university - you are still above average in a grand sense.""  I also see this ALL the time in comments on this page.

While this *may* be true (I don't 100% believe that, after all STEM !> humanities), it just seems to be a super weird thing to say.  Why is your ""confidence"" based on being better than other people?  Sometimes it is super annoying to work with another MIT student at a company because they often look their noses down at kids from other colleges and they refuse to learn from them.  Like stop.  Stop getting your self worth from being better than other people.  Sometimes you aren't the best.  And that's okay.

I have an older sister who is a freaking prodigy so I had to learn this lesson super young.  I would sometimes say, ""she is really, really smart - she gets things faster than me.""  And my friends and parents would be so concerned about my self-esteem when I said that.  I later had to explain to them that just because I knew I wasn't better at her at school or at music than her didn't mean I wasn't confident in myself.  A lot of people at my high school didn't see it that way.  They thought the way a lot of you guys think - they got their self-worth from being the best.  And they saw her as a threat.  They told her everyday that she was stupid and basically bullied her.  My sister to this day doesn't realize how smart she is, how she has the freaking Midas Touch all because a few self-conscious people couldn't stand the thought of not being the best.

So how do I get my confidence?  From the knowledge that everyday I am here, I get better than I was yesterday and I test *my* limits.  And my only competition is myself.",,status,,2015-10-26 20:52:46,665,3,30,664,1,0,0,0,0,0

In this instance, the train by default goes straight. Changing the track makes him responsible for the single death, and therefore a murderer. Is he responsible for the five deaths if he does nothing? If yes, then he is responsible for all deaths you could prevent but do nothing about. If not, he has no obligation to pull it.

I think most here would say you should pull the lever. However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives. Ignorance of how you can save someone is not an excuse, since you can always use time when you can't save someone to gather more information so that you can.

I'm on the side where I think we should try to save as many people as possible. I also know that I'm not doing as much as I can to save people. Doing this burdens me with extreme guilt, because I recognize that I'm responsible for a large number of deaths. I completely understand and respect why someone wouldn't want to deal with the guilt of blood on their hands.

A decent number of high schools where I am from used to have weekly assemblies of the student body. At the time, I took these for granted but in hindsight, it was nice and almost therapeutic to have a chance to talk to people whom I otherwise wouldn't have had an excuse to interact with. While it's college and I'm guessing people don't want to have ""assemblies"", it would be nice if there were more campus-wide events.

Here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but I hope you read on beyond for my explanation: The fact is that I do consider some people to be more amazing than others, I mean that's only natural. That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. The point is that we are all so amazing that I guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. Yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing.

""You are the most amazing person I've ever had the privilege of meeting"" -Someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but I have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right.

And the best part is, since we are the superpower of the world, we can borrow from other nations non stop and if we can't make the payments, we just tell them to take a hike and default.

For example, you cannot import drugs from other countries. You can get them so cheaply elsewhere, but it's illegal to get them here. Another problem is buying insurance. You can't buy across state lines. So each state insurer gets their own monopoly and doesn't have to compete.

My dad finished high-school and never went to college, my mom didn't even finish high-school. They had to work 12+ hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week at dead end jobs to support us. I escaped reality by throwing myself into academics and got here as a result. My friends here have been supportive of me but there have been times where we had to deal with different sets of thinking. For example, both my parents smoke, my older brothers also smoke, and they all smoke in the house we live in. When I casually mentioned to my friends that they wouldn't like my house since it smells of heavy tobacco they flipped out and asked how any parent could subject their child to it and told me that I was an ""abuse victim"". It took a very long, patient, explanation and I want to share it because I feel that a lot of the middle class and rich students here do not get it, quite frankly. Most poor people smoke and are now the majority of smokers. One big reason is poor people don't get weekends, or vacations to a beach house, or yacht club. For many of them, a cigarette is the only break they get. And some people say, well what about 20 - 40 years from now? When you are barely scrapping enough money to pay rent and put food on the table today, 20 years from now is as far from  your mind as it can be. And about smoking in front of me, first of all, second hand smoke isn't nearly as dangerous as smoking itself, and if you read the studies, (I have quite thoroughly.) they admit you have to be around it in an extremely concentrated manner for decades to have any tangible effect. What I had, a few family members who would have a couple smokes after dinner at the table, does not nearly qualify. Also, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is very normal. What I ask my fellow students is to please stop rushing to judge poor people for not following middle class and wealthy people in lock step, money makes a massive difference. And please don't call me an ""abuse victim"". To compare people smoking cigarettes in front of you to a parent physically harming their child is insulting to people who have had to deal with it.",,status,,2015-10-05 11:47:59,244,2,1,244,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most people don't use, and usually don't need critical thinking anyway. The real reason teachers are against it is because they don't want to face the music and have to take the chance that they might be exposed as incompetent and get fired. Also, nobody admits this, but they could actually turn down the standardized tests legally. All they have to do is turn down federal funding.

I looked at the US birth rates. Secular and atheist birthrates are the lowest, and well below sustainability. Fertility for atheist women is about 1.5 children, hardcore religious, 2.5 - 6 per woman! Meaning the next generation of atheists will be smaller. Meanwhile the hardcore religious have the highest birthrates of all. The amish, mormons, devout Catholics, evangicals, all breed like rabbits. In the last 20 years the amish population has TRIPLED from birthrates alone. Immigrants here also tend to be more religious. If this continues in a couple generations we will go from a nation making secular progress back to a religious hive on the level of a middle eastern nation. So I urge all my fellow atheists and secular members, please make a point to have more children and raise them atheists. A good number to be safe is 3 or 4 children per couple to insure atheist population growth.

462508190484900_949064431829271,u,"#1825 Earlier I posted a confession about the level of sexual acts I have witnessed here. I want to anonymously address two comments there which addressed good points.

One asked if I felt that a womans value only came from her sexual history and willingness. The other asked why I was talking about the women and not the men involved. The reason I choose to address women is because I feel this is an issue that harms women the most. To the women here I will be completely honest with you. The harsh reality is, in our society you have very little power as a whole. Men hold most of it. Sex is one of the few areas you can say no to definitively. Power is the ability to say no. The second you give that up, you lose power. This is not going to change anytime soon. Men have sex for very different reasons then you do. Women for the most part see it as the beginning of developing an emotional bond. Men simply see it as a recreational activity. Sex may be an act of love and fun for women, but for men it's an act of power, control, recreation, and in some negative circumstances, violence. Men tend to get into relationships and marriage for regular guaranteed sex, not so much the emotional bonds that women get into relationships for.

To answer the question of the value of women, no a woman's intrinsic human value is not based on sexual history. Unfortunately for men, her value as a partner in a relationship is. And guilt tripping men trying to tell them to change millions of years of gut instinct is not going to help. What I am recommending to women is to wait for a committed relationship. You have to make your partner wait, treat you well, and value you, and work for you physically. People value scarcity. And the key to dealing with the power dynamic of sex is to get the guy to commit then get sex. That way even though you have submitted and relinquished sex, he has submitted and relinquished some of his freedom. That way even though you have given up the sexual power, he still respects you and treats you well.",,status,,2015-09-23 9:07:25,4,29,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm pale, you can tell I'm part black when I grow my hair out but I tend to keep it short and everyone who doesn't know me assumes I'm a tan white guy, and usually they guess I'm Italian. When I applied my guidance counselor who was white tried to get me to put down black as my race. I pointed out that I look white and am mostly white so white made the most sense. He persisted and made the argument that I've had a ""tough time"" as a ""person of color"" in life, so I should do it to ""help ease the admissions process"". I'm from a rich Jewish long island suburb I've been very fortunate. So I want to say to all white people out there who I one of, black people are not your little pity cases. Doing someone a favor for no reason other then them being black is condescending. Stop trying to be a white savior.

My new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive MIT. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months.

I didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be at MIT?

I realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a fucked up place. Somehow, the faculty and staff have lost humanity amidst psets and exams and grades. I even forgot that I'm more than a sum of my academic achievements.

It's not that I thoroughly hate myself.  It's just that sometimes I want to see what would happen if I really was gone forever.  How would my family take it, how would MIT take it, how would my friends take it, how would people in my dorm and especially my hallmates take it?  Honestly, I think there'd be a week at most of sadness and then people would move on, just like when the last couple of students who offed themselves.  So it's really not worth it.

For the longest time, I loved my dorm, my hall, my hall mates. They were my best friends, people I hung out with, people I did my homework with. I cared so much about every single one of them and was there for them all the time. I thought it was the same for me too. I thought that they would stop by my door and ask why I haven't been to class for that long. I thought they would stop by to ask if I was ok, maybe give me a hug and tell me that everything would be ok. But they never did. And that's when I stopped giving a shit about them. I stopped caring and constantly trying to fit in. If you don't care about me, why would I care about you?

I think what's different about this tragedy for me is that it no longer seems unattached and distant from my life.

Now he's gone back to his apartment and I'm wearing it while studying for finals. I can't wait to go home for winter break so he can take me on a walk in the forest preserve back home...

It's a really damn good escape.  
Also, I love my boyfriend so much for putting up with all my quirks and insanity like this. Like...

And apparently, I'm not attracted to non-asian faces. I don't understand why that's necessarily racist. On the other hand, no one thinks I'm sexist for only liking girls. 

Yes, all my relationships have been with asian girls, but they've been meaningful and with people I loved, and saying that I dated them ""just because they were asian"" is like saying I dated them ""just because they were girls"". I only date people I can be attracted to--but that's not exactly shocking behavior.

But there's SO MUCH stigma against white people exclusively dating asian girls.  I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable talking about this part of myself, even though I don't understand why it offends people. Why does it feel like all the orientation tolerance and openness at MIT extends only to a narrow range of ""socially acceptable"" sexual orientations? Doesn't that defeat the point?",,status,,2014-12-13 14:19:54,38,8,0,38,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example the Duke lacrosse scandal a couple years ago ruined several young men's lives even though it was later found that they were completely innocent, as the ""victim"" simply lied.

I grew up in a relatively poor family, and my parents weren't friends with anybody, and they also didn't know(and therefore never taught me) any of the American social courtesies. Like, I never ever said ""thank you"" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.  

When I first started going to science camps in high school, I was really impressed with everyone and felt inferior to everyone. I met people who had already done research before, or who had done these science olympiads, or had built robots and stuff. But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like ""blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research"" or ""blah blah my teacher got me started in this"" or even ""blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in"" blah blah blah. Oh and also “blah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here.” Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords “science” and “financial assistance.” I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges. 

I find it so weird that had I not started googling things that one night when I felt too exhausted to do work, or started applying to those camps on a whim, I probably never would have even known what a tiny bubble I had been living in, and about the countless opportunities that other people took for granted. I probably never would have applied to MIT. 

Now that I’m at MIT, I realize that I have become one of those privileged people, and that I have the opportunity to network if I so choose—that some person would give something I say more consideration just because I go to MIT. And I hate the fact that door is open to me. I hate the fact that door is open to anyone. After so many years of living in fear of the future, and having no idea where my life was headed, I don’t think I’ll ever be comfortable accepting anything I didn’t directly earn through grueling, hard work.

Someone posted a while ago that they think their ""empathy is broken"", and I really feel the same - I knew Phoebe, but her death really, truly did not perturb me in the slightest. Sometimes I think that there's something wrong with me, and sometimes I think there's something wrong with the rest of the world, but I legitimately don't give a fuck about ""feelings"", ""honor"", ""empathy"" or other intangibles. 

This doesn't mean I'm continuously rude or selfish - I know how society works and conscious play the game to get ahead. But every expression, word, and action is a deliberate, calculated move to achieve a goal, never a relatable reaction. Usually this is exhilarating - liberating - I feel like I'm in absolute control of my life and most of the world around me - I feel like I can effect virtually anything I choose just by coordinating the right sequence of moves in the game.

But other times it's crushing, lonely, and bland, as if I've beaten the game but am still trapped in the same campaign, over and over and over again. Sometimes I'm ridiculously paranoid about people's motives, envisioning elaborate cons that they're manipulating, but in the end I'm only dreaming, *wishing* that they were because then I wouldn't be the only one.

Usually when I confide this to people, they'll smirk and nod, think I'm obsessed with Sherlock or Spock, and secretly lament that I've been so sheltered. When I do actually experience loss or [emotional stimulant], they say, I'll realize how foolish I am. Then they go back to their shallow little lives, splash around in their kiddie pool of friends and, if they're lucky or ambitious, make a few ripples of drama in society at large. Good for them.

He's currently in a mental facility being held against his will because he drove to my hometown and started screaming about it being the devil's den, but I'm so scared that when he gets out he's going to try to kill people. I think I'm on the list, but I'm more afraid he's going to do a mass shooting.
I have spoken to the police, they were instrumental in having him committed for 72+ hours in a special facility (instead of spending only 48 hours in the hospital). But he hasn't made any explicit threats, so no crime has been committed aside from maybe disturbing the peace.
I can't believe this is happening in my life. I'm sitting here working on psets, as if there wasn't a person merely hours away who's locked up, violently deluded, and probably growing more and more angry with every passing minute. At least they can sedate him so he can sleep for the first time in a long time…but I don't think he will be cured before he's released.",,status,,2014-10-15 13:25:26,8,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm going to be brutally honest.  I'm a girl, and I actually agreed with a lot of the things that Bill Frezza was talking about.  He went a little overboard on points, but in light of the LCA incident and the frat ban now and last year, he was probably a bit worked up about everything and said things he probably regrets.  

Outside of MIT is a different story, but within our school, I believe that a lot of frats here really do try to follow the basic rules.  Yeah, they're going to have alcohol, but when it comes to the serious situations of rape and sexual assault, the fraternity as a whole is not going to encourage and support those kinds of behavior.  I think what Frezza was trying to say was that fraternities have control over themselves, but not their guests--and there's a larger consequence if something happens to a guest that is a female (which is a whole different topic).  There's a potential for a lot of misunderstandings that could blow up into things that could bring down the frat.  

I'm not talking about sexual assault or rape cases. That's the fault of the person who committed those actions (but still not the fraternity as a whole).  I'm talking about people who are intoxicated who make poor decisions because of their state and end up hurting themselves and blaming the frat. Most of us have been to a frat party.  There's a lot of people to watch out for, and a situation like that is really hard to prevent.  And unfortunately, the situation is a lot worse if that accident happens to a girl rather than a guy.  Politically that's just how it is.  

And let's be honest, the response article was a dramatic, exaggeration of the LCA situation.  ""an intoxicated girl 'danced out' a frat house window, thereby ruining the party.  I'm pretty sure the brothers, all the other frats, and the rest of campus took that more seriously than a party buzzkill.",,status,,2014-10-01 17:34:55,35,4,1,35,0,0,0,0,0,0

It certainly caught my attention. It was big and bold and impossible to avoid. I thought it was wasteful at first. Sure, they could have done something else, but any complaining about the blue ribbon tape is, I feel, quite unjustified. The only reason I see people complaining is because they are an environmental group; I am sad to see that the same people are not complaining about the yellow ribbon MIT Facilities puts up on Kresge nearly every week, in an absolutely futile attempt to keep the grass green. It is akin to criticizing them for putting up copious amounts of paper to broadcast their events, just like every single other student group on campus. Are we to restrict this group, that is fighting to combat global climate change, to solely forms of communication that in no way affect the environment? If you have to use a few trees, or use a few gallons of gas, in order to save billions of trees and human life as we know it, by all means, you have my blessing.

Thank you, Fossil Free MIT. I am not a member, but your display brought a great issue to light. Everyone is talking about it, and even if they are discussing it negatively, at least they are talking about it. Plus, you got a response from President Reif! Go you! Please continue to encourage people to divest from fossil fuels, and make the world a better place. And if you have to use a few yards of blue ribbon tape once every year, by all means, do so: I think the cause you are fighting for is a little bit bigger than a roll of blue ribbon tape.

I don't want to go into detail but they made me feel like complete shit.  I thought that maybe my experience was just especially awful but when I talked to friends, they said that they had similar experiences at MIT Mental Health.  I found out later that working it out with my boyfriend's help (who actually cared about me) was a lot better.  Sure, going to MIT Health was a good first step (made me realize I had a problem), it didn't help my problem at ALL.

So maybe try MIT Medical but I would definitely suggest telling some you trust your problems.  Maybe a parent, a sister, a uncle, a good friend, anyone.

In particular, their decision to put a blue rope around campus is quite hypocritical and counter productive. Fossil Free MIT seeks to divest MIT away from fossil fuel and promote sustainability yet their blue ropes did just the opposite. 
1) Those blue ropes are mostly made out of petroleum, specifically polypropylene, which uses fossil fuels to produce and transport. 
2) The the extensive use of the tape is wasteful use of resource. If this was a PR stunt, very few people had the time to stop to actually read the text on the tape - most people viewed it as a construction caution tape. People probably viewed it as a nuisance than informative as it was spread all over the place and made our campus look aesthetically displeasing.
3) The tape harms the environment. If Fossil Free MIT cared about sustainability, they should have realized that some of the tape they place came undone and flew away. Much like littering, those tape pieces now have the potential to get stuck around a bird's wing, chock a bird who accidentally swallows it, pollute the Charles River, etc. Considering that the tape was made from petroleum, it most likely will not biodegrade, leading to long term waste.

I'd rush doing my P-sets and Labs so that I could do something amazing with her.

Then, this semester, everything changed. She would just ignore me, and get angry at me for no reason. She would ignore me, make me suffer and cry, and never say sorry. She really made me sad. We broke up a while ago and don't talk to each other anymore. 

I feel kinda lost, and all the energy that I had for P-sets and Labs are gone. Even though it is silly, I'd do them earlier and faster to stay with her. Now I can't see a reason to do them...

Listen, white or not white, we all have struggles. And I know you feel hated on because everyone says you get special treatment and all minorities are oppressed because of it, and they're totally milking it and blah blah blah.
But just imagine--with all the hardships that EVERYONE has to go through, it would be nice for people of color to not get judged simply for being of color. To not be doubted on a daily basis about their intellectual ability because ""they're only here because of affirmative action."" It would be nice to not get looked at funny when you go to a store and are followed around by (usually white) employees because not being white apparently makes you a shoplifter. It'd be nice to walk down a street without people clutching their purses or children closer, or CROSSING THE FUCKING STREET because they're scared to pass you because you're not white so you MUST be a criminal. It would be nice to not have to worry about your parents being discriminated against and not realizing it because you're not there to understand when someone throws racial slurs at them and since they don't understand because English just happens to be a bitchy language to learn, all they can do is smile and greet them. Or to be worried that you're not there to translate your younger siblings' school papers to them so they don't always know what's going on. Is it really too much to ask to be treated fairly? I mean, look at what society is calling people of color. MINORITIES. They are automatically labeled as something INFERIOR. 
So please. If you're gonna go complaining because you're always seen as just another good citizen while people of color are constantly being accused of being criminals of the world for not having been born white, or because on top of all your other problems you AT LEAST have to deal with people seeing you as THE MINORITY--go do it with other privileged human beings and stop asking the people that are currently on the short end of the stick to feel sorry for you. And if you're trolling, go make yourself useful and do something nice for people for a change. The world is fucked up enough without you making people's lives even more annoying to deal with.

P.S. Also, FYI, that's only SOME of the shit a Latina has to go through. So fuck off.

I can guess that he doesn't feel the same about me, but I still want to ask him out. Any thoughts or advice?",,status,,2014-02-01 11:57:46,12,9,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0

""If I may add, I personally felt no humanistic compassion from none of the politician speakers: they referred to THEM and US, the bad guys and the good guys (not just bad, they actually used some very negative adjectives: knock-off jihadis, perverse, etc etc). There was too much hate in their speech at times. The sad thing about politicians as I keep noticing from one country to another, is that they don't seem to care much about humanity. their values are very close to only one community, not caring about the other communities- I mean, that's not a bad thing, as long as you remind your community that there is a bigger picture as well, and that all humans are worthy of your love. We are all one. This whole world, the people everywhere are all good, kind people. Some are misled, instead of hating them and giving way to hate, why don't we start trying to fix them. Teaching them to love. Not hating them back and judging them and not giving them second chances.
It's not Boston ONE. It's humans ONE (humans in Boston in our case)- it was the love for people that made those brave Bostonians reach out and help during that catastrophe, it was not the fact that they had to help the Bostonians. Tell me, did those brave Boston men and women ask ""Oh, where are you from? So we know if we should help you or not?"". and it is sad that people at power don't understand it- or even worse, they don't care as long as it helps them politically. Saying things that do not inspire love or care for other people, they don't understand that the majority might just be carried away in those feeling of hate towards some other miserable person that for who-knows-what reasons has been brainwashed and misled into the hate and destruction. Our enemies are Hate and Destruction. Not people. I totally agree with both #440 and #437. And I'm glad looking at some many people think this way. I'm really glad.
