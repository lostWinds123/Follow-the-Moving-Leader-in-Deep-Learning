I can't stand it when people comment on these posts ""message me if you need to talk,"" or ""you're beautiful.""

TL;DR: I hate what I see as insincere compliments and I think some well-meaning (and/or self-serving) student is better off referencing someone in crisis to a professional than trying to help themselves. I would feel worse.

PS. I will be disappointed in humanity if someone comments on this ""message me to talk"" or implies that this demonstrates my own low self-esteem and tries to tell me I'm awesome.

I told you that I would write you poetry.  I don't know if you believed me!
But I can't write poetry.  My words are weak.  All I can hope to do is speak plainly and see if that's enough!
I don't know you well enough to say what sort of a person you are.  We've barely talked, yet we smile at each other:
I don't know if that fact is beautiful, but I suspect so.
I told you the first time we met that you were the image of grace!  
I stand by this!
Who could be so egoistic as to write poetry to you?  You are poetry!  
Your smile!  Who doesn't get feel a little envious of Richard Powers every time you smile up at him!
You--certainly, the image of beauty.  No one can match your face, your form, your movements, your smile.
But I don't know how much it means, after all.  
I don't know where you came from, or where you hope to go, 
or who your mother is, or what sort of burden you carry, 
Or why you dance, or what you think of yourself,
Or what it is like to be a beautiful woman in this world!!
I said once that you might be a personification of the moon.  I don't know why I feel this way.  
But I see you more often than her, which in the end is a great pity.

I am sure that you are a beautiful person too, as well as being pretty!  
I am sure of this.
I am sure of this because everyone seems to turn out to be.

The thing I hate most about affirmative action is the idiotic, oversimplifying assumption that if you're black (substitute your favorite minority in the rest of this post. Using black for simplicity.) your life was hard, and if you're white (substitute your favorite evil majority in the rest of this post. Using white for simplicity.), your life was easy.

Basically, if you're a low-income white, fuck you. Your application is probably not as impressive as the super-rich white's, given that your background did not give you as many opportunities. So, you lose against them. Then, when put against a minority, you lose, too, because your race is not as politically cool to accept (there're too many white people in power, am i rite?!!?!). If you ever speak out, you’re a racist -- last year or so, there were some people trying to make a white-only scholarship for exactly these low-income men and women. They were shot down by various political groups as if they were the devil incarnate. The very few who do get in anyway are rightfully pissed, post on Stanford Confessions, and are shot down further.

Affirmative action is a naive, misguided effort that punishes the wrong people. The ones that are so popular to hate (“super rich evil whites”) will get in anyway. Even if they don’t, they have enough money to live and “oppress” for years to come regardless of whether you give them a prestigious college diploma. As usual, the little guy loses because one of the big guys pissed someone off. 

So, why not judge everyone individually, with race never coming into play (i.e., don’t discriminate based on race by using different application pools, etc.)? If someone has provably suffered some hardship in life (because of discrimination, disability, low income, whatever), then sure, boost their application; their accomplishments are all the more impressive if they were achieved in shitty conditions. But boost on a case by case basis, not because of what boxes they checked under race in their app. And yes, on average, this might result in boosting blacks’ applications more often than those of whites’, this is perfectly fine. But doing so blindly, across the board, just to make sure there's a certain percentage of each race/sex, is political correctness bullshit. It’s not fair in any reasonable sense of the word, and all it does is encourage people to victimize themselves (i.e., your college counselor tells you to check “pacific islander” rather than “asian” -- friend’s experience), even in cases where it’s doubtful whether that’s actually true.

No, I'm not a bad looking girl being spiteful. I am, at the very least, decent looking. 

I am so tired of the girls at Stanford emphasizing looks as their first priority. I came to Stanford hoping to finally meet girls who were ambitious and wanted more out of life than to just be pretty and marry rich men. I feel like I've met girls like that, but the majority of girls I hang out with are not. Yes, you meet girls studying all sorts of cool things and wanting interesting careers, but at the end of the day, sometimes it feels like their first priority is putting on good makeup. I feel like there is something to be said, no matter how good or bad looking you are, for being comfortable stepping out of the house looking terrible. It just means you know you are worth more than just your looks, and most of the girls I hang out with don't even go over to late night in their pyjamas. I feel weird in my group of girls because it can sometimes sound like life to them is a race to get a good boyfriend. Even the ones who have only been single for a few weeks are desperately looking for new guys. Why do you need a boyfriend so badly? I never hear my single guy friends obsessing over how girls don't like them. Even girls who are very good looking are just sitting there obsessing about boys and makeup and hair and nails instead of using the very smart brains that got them to Stanford. It frustrates me. I know a huge part of it is just the company I've kept though.

You girls are geniuses, get up, realize that it's not the end of the world if you graduate without a boyfriend, and that you're not single because you're not pretty enough, maybe you just haven't found someone that likes your PERSONALITY a lot.

Therefore, the bar is higher for the majority. Please don't pretend like this is not true. I'm not trying to argue whether this is fair or not. I'm stating a simple fact of how it works.

Also don't pretend that this is somehow racist; there are plenty of minority people here who'd get in regardless of the existence of affirmative action. But there are also some that would not.""",,status,,2014-02-24 1:00:00,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1426440834254162_1450593268505585,u,"""Can we do away with Stanford Confessions? I'm about to unlike this page, but I feel like this needs to be said before I do. When I liked this page, I thought this would be a place that we could anonymously confess to our mini-crushes, various little truths we're not ready to admit out loud, and just to gather and listen to one another as we share a little bit about ourselves that we're not ready to say in person. Yet that's not what this page is. At all.

Stanford Confessions has turned into a page where insecure students at Stanford try to pull down other students. You guys want an affirmation that your major is better than other majors, that you deserve to be here more than some other people for whatever reason, and that you're an all-around amazing person while everyone else sucks. But I should just go ahead and tell you that writing this down on some anonymous form in hopes that someone reads it and feels inferior to you won't work. It will not make this any more true. 

Give it up. Embrace your insecurities. You are not better than anyone else. Look around, that girl in your math class? She's a genius. That guy you converse with in Spanish? He could run/swim a mile with you and overlap you twice. And that person on the floor above you will probably save the world once and twice. And yes, that frustrates you. You start reexamining your life and wonder if you'll ever match up. And you start struggling with admitting that everyone around you is freaking AWESOME in some way. So what do you do? You go to Stanford Confessions and try to make at least someone feel less awesome than you. But, just saying, that's not going to make them any less amazing, no matter how hard you try.

So I'm going to give you some advice. Try to focus on believing in yourself. Remember that you're here for a reason. There's something that makes you deserving of your acceptance to Stanford, because we all are. And one of the most beautiful things about getting to go to a school like Stanford is having the opportunity to interact with the freaking amazing people all around you.

So stop trying to pull others down to your level. Instead pull yourself up. Don't get insecure about the accomplishments and potential of everyone around you, get INSPIRED. Aspire to learn more, do more, and love yourself more. Then change your attitude and realize that we're all in this together. We're family. That's why we're able to write some very real confessions on this page. And know that if one of us does better, earns a Nobel Prize, becomes the next President of the United States, or wins an Olympic gold medal, we are ALL better for it. We're Stanford. Together. So yeah, continue to confess, But allow this to be a support system for others. Because in reality we ALL need each other to succeed.

Abstract: """"... We instead examined the possibility that individuals resist social change because they have negative stereotypes of activists, the agents of social change. Participants had negative stereotypes of activists (feminists and environmentalists), regardless of the domain of activism, viewing them as eccentric and militant. Furthermore, these stereotypes reduced participants' willingness to affiliate with ‘typical’ activists and, ultimately, to adopt the behaviours that these activists promoted.""""

By the way I am fully aware that if you have more than three finals on the same day you can move one....but I wasn't paying attention (as usual) and did not realize I had four until the day before. Plus I had not studied one minute for any of them... Solution: (this takes huge balls by the way, I'm a girl but somehow when your in a really SHIT situation balls tend to manifest themselves)

8 AM came around and I was sitting in class for my first of four finals. I looked through the ridiculously huge packet, realized I knew ABSOLUTELY F**** nothing and put my plan into action.

Step 1: Take your phone out of your backpack, stare at it with a confused look on your face.
Step 2: Stand up, phone in hand (by this time your professor is probably looking at you like WTF) but don't worry it is all part of the plan.
Step 3: Leave your backpack behind and walk out of the classroom without saying a word.
Step 4: Walk into the hallway outside of your class. Make certain your phone is off. Begin dramatizing how you would react if someone was on the other line giving you really really bad news ( someone has just died bad news). Make sure you speak up so that the class on the other side of the door can hear you.
Step 5: Burst back into the class room with a devastated look on your face. Grab your shit. Hand the professor the exam and tell him you have to go. ( The professor will know something is seriously wrong because he/she would have heard you outside the door in the hallway.)
Step 6: High tail it out of there. You have just walked out of your exam successfully.  
Step 7: Wait a couple of hours, then email the professor saying someone in your family just died and you are leaving Palo Alto now.
Step 8: Wait for the reply, which will 99.9% will be """" I understand, my deepest sympathies, please contact me when possible to reschedule the exam.""""
Step 9: Email your other three professors, telling them what went down, how you left in the middle of your exam that morning, and If they have any questions or concerns to please contact the professor or the class you walked out of.
Step 10: CELEBRATE you have just successfully rescheduled four finals and bought yourself three or four days of study time (grieving time)!

***Warning: This is a true story. Please proceed with caution. After I walked out of class that day and got to my apt I got a phone call just seconds after I entered the door. It was my Dad who told me the following sentence """" Your aunt passed away less than an hour ago."""" There is no such thing as luck... KARMA IS A B****

I was thinking about her day and night, and I loved her so much that I thought I would never fall in love with anybody else. Then after we started talking and knowing each other better, I felt that she started to like me, and my other friends who were with us told me the same thing. So, she started to find dumb excuses to spend more time with me. 

However, I knew that she was in a serious relationship with a great guy and they were having wonderful romance. When I felt that she liked me (which was becoming more and more obvious), I started to slowly push her away from me until we were “hello, how are you?” type of friends. I understand that she’s a human and she has feelings and needs, but I also knew that she was making a big mistake. I did not ever want to be involved in cheating or destroying the guys’ life. I thought of how I might feel if some other guy did that to my girlfriend, and how much pain and sadness that could cause.

When I look back, this was one of the best decisions I’ve made it my life. My heart wanted her more than anything else in life, but I came to learn that you shouldn’t always follow your feelings and let them overtake you. You must evaluate the situation and future outcomes with a sound-mind. I learned self-disciple and self-control. This gave me a sense of power over my own mind and emotions. 

After a few months of terrible pain and torture, I managed to push away all the intense love feeling I had for her. As a result, she is still having an amazing relationship with the guy and they are both happy and in love with each other. As for me, I am happy that I was able to make her joyful and kept her away from ruining her relationship.

1426440834254162_1434714910093421,f,"""During the summer, I met a kid who belongs to a frat - which I won’t say. I’ll call him John. I don’t usually hang out anyone from the Greek community, but this was my chance to put all the rumors I had heard to the test. So, I would go over to his house and we would engage in real conversations about each other’s lives. At first he seemed really nice. 

Over the course of a few weeks, I learned that he is obsessed with his image. I learned that he is just as insecure about his body as a 13-year-old girl. I learned that he is ashamed of his older sister for being a lesbian because he perceives her as “weak”. He had not spoken to her since she came out. What a loving and supportive brother. The funny thing is he didn’t know I was bisexual….until I told immediately after that statement. I could see the embarrassment in his eyes. 

I met some of his brothers, one of which I cannot forget. I’ll call him Alex. The conversation of alcohol limits came up. I knew that drinking was a staple of Greek culture, but as an intelligent, loving, caring, and independent human being, I asserted that one’s health should come before a college social organization. John wouldn’t have any of it. In a militant manner, he reprimanded Alex for his inability to “handle” his alcohol. He demanded that instead of limiting his drinks, Alex should increase his alcohol intake (to increase his tolerance) because his social standing in Greek life depends on it. The social standing of their house depends on it. After a heated discussion about alcohol and limits, John gets up to use the bathroom. 

A moment after John closed the door, Joe confessed: “The reason I don’t want to drink is because I become violent with girls. I’ve been called a rapist by female hecklers because of what they heard. I have a hard time controlling myself when I drink a lot”
“…..Does John know about this?..”
“…Yeah..”
“…Um…that’s not okay. I know what John thinks, but personally I think you should limit your alcohol. I don’t think you should be drinking more; that would just make things worse. You need to care of yourself…”

The door handle stirs. 
We both look at each other. We say nothing, but we silently agree. 
I had an eerie feeling when John walked back into the room. He felt like an oppressive force. I could not understand why John, a “brother”, and alleged friend of Alex’s, would completely disregard Alex’s well being for the sake of his own image. Selfish. Manipulative. Cold. Repulsive. 
I felt sorry for both of them. Both John and Alex were victims of a flawed culture. I could not understand what the appeal was. I could not understand why they continue to uphold ridiculous values and allow the self-destruction of their friends and loved ones.

John and I did have casual sex. He was sweet, passionate, and gentle. However, I noticed a change in John’s character, night to day.
He came to my house for the first time. I was still in the process of moving in, but tried to make him comfortable. We were about to watch a show on Netflix when he said, “You know, I don’t like cuddling. I don’t want to come over and do all this. I just want to come here, have sex, and leave. I want to be good at something. I mean, you’re good at blowjobs. I want to be known for eating girls out like a champ. Summer’s about to end and we shouldn’t see each other when school starts. I want to use this time to improve my skills.”
Yes, this actually happened. 
Needless to say, I explained to him why I felt dehumanized, and stopped talking to him after that day. Ain’t nobody got time for that bullshit.

What’s also amusing is that a few weeks later, one of my employers told me John had been not only been asking for my old position at the shop, but also took the opportunity to comment on my inability to maintain that position. Spiteful, no? 
Without knowing the gruesome details of my experience with John, my boss and my fellow employees had already concluded he was an asshole. We made sure he didn’t get the position. 

Moral of the story: Being an asshole is the most trivial and pathetic thing you could ever invest your time, money, and energy in. Don’t try so hard.""",,status,,2014-01-06 23:00:01,3,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, your bad posture, hygiene, and social skills are not ""cute"" nor are they ""hipster."" No one like nerds in real life. And Stanford University is awful because it actually encourages people to be nerds. Newsflash: Stanford is the last place where being a nerd will ever help you in life. After you graduate the glory train is over and your nerdiness will only get you passed up for romance, job promotions, and respect in all facets. No one gives a shit if you get an A+ in Math 51H, the ability to throw a football is infinitely more important in American culture. But keep deluding yourself to think you're gonna hit it big and get rich after graduating. In reality? You'll make 200K at tops (yes, you banking idiots as well, you'll never make it big if you weren't born into it), pay 90% of it in taxes/student loans/toys to keep yourself busy so you don't see the truth. You'll drive a 8 year old Toyota Camry, and marry the first person that says hi to you (and they'll probs divorce you too) and continue the generational decline of nerd-scum by breeding offspring that'll go to Stanford like Mommy or Daddy. Instead of teaching your children good life skills, like how to defend yourself in a dangerous situation, or how to conduct yourself in a social settings, you'll simply drill piano practices and tell your kids to get A+s in school. Congrats, you've raised another generation of smart-idiots who can solve equations, but can't think for themselves or live an actual life.
